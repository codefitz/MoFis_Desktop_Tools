# Screen-Share Window

This project creates a transparent, resizable, and movable overlay window for screen sharing on ultra-wide monitors. It allows you to share a portion of your desktop without having to set a specific application, enabling seamless switching between different applications during screen sharing sessions.

## Features

- **Resizable and movable window:** The window can be resized and moved around the screen.
- **Transparent regions:** You can see through the window except for the border and title bar.
- **Easy to use:** Simple controls for opening, closing, minimizing, restoring, and resizing the window.
- **Expand options:** Expand the window to full screen, left screen, or right screen with a single click.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- `tkinter` for the GUI
